1. As a group, what is the thing you’re most proud of for this round of critique?

We’re most proud of our collaboration strategy, which leveraged each of our individual strengths and resources. During the interview phase, we reached a strong variety of subjects, with Yuwei’s connections in academia, and Ollie’s connections to designers and educators. During the research synthesis phase, we were able to leverage Michael’s artistic skills to create compelling storyboards and Brian’s ability to streamline and communicate our user research methodology effectively.

2. As a group, what is one thing you want to improve upon for the final presentation and showcase?

We purposefully kept our user research goals broad in order to gain a sense of what sorts of tensions exist in the paper reading process. We’ve identified a thread that involves stringing together reading intention, and have collected additional data to make informed decisions upon this thread. As such, we would like to improve upon the specificity of our problem statement as we transition to implementing our system. Such specificity will enable us to communicate our intent and results with greater direction during the final presentation and showcase.

3. As a group, what is your next priority? Suggestion: Discuss what you think is the biggest open question/source of uncertainty/potential hole in your project that could "threaten" its success.

In our response to the previous question, we discuss the notion of reducing our project scope through further specification of the problem statement. This is indeed our next priority. While further development of the “connecting reading intentions” idea seems to be a generative next step, we believe the efficacy of this approach is the largest uncertainty that remains in our project. To put it simply, we hope that we are solving an underlying issue, rather than creating an issue to solve.

4. What steps will you take to address this priority?

Our next step, after specifying our problem statement, will be to begin on rapid prototyping and user testing of our interactive system. We plan on repeating this process multiple times (hopefully using practices that we learn during lecture in the next few weeks) in order to ensure our system has high efficacy.

5. Will you and your group try a big pivot and then catch up? How?

At the moment, our group will not be attempting a significant pivot. We have identified a problem area, and believe we are able to offer a solution.

6. What support do you need to be successful for the remainder of your project?

1. Guidance on how to develop a prototype, from (1) a wireframing perspective and (2) a technical perspective, i.e., how to distill the most essential features into a platform that is usable by testers but not too complex to implement.
2. Methods to evaluate the efficacy of our system.

Did you use a generative AI tool? If so, which and how?

No generative AI tool used.

How long did this reflection take your group?
