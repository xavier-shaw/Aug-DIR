## Model Paper & Why
We selected *Qlarify: Recursively Expandable Abstracts for Directed Information Retrieval over Scientific Papers* as our model paper because its topic closely aligns with our project. Moreover, the purpose of its need-finding formative study and chosen methodology are similar to ours. Notably, this paper was published in a top-tier HCI conference, making it a solid reference for HCI paper writing.

## Formative Study

To explore how readers engage with scientific papers and interact with data while reading, we conducted a formative study observing participants as they read a data-intensive paper in a familiar domain.

### 1. Participants
We recruited participants through personal connections. All participants were current or former computer science students and reported familiarity with reading scientific papers. The study was conducted in a digital setting.

### 2. Procedure
After introducing the study and obtaining consent, participants answered a few questions about their reading frequency and habits. They were then given a paper to read and asked to respond to three questions upon finishing. While reading, participants were encouraged to verbalize their behaviors, thoughts, questions, and any confusions they encountered. After completing the reading task, they answered additional questions about their experience with the paper. Each session lasted approximately 50 minutes, and participants were thanked for their time.

### 3. Findings
Our observations revealed two reading processes participants had while reading a paper:

- **Skimming**. Participants sought to gain a high-level understanding of the paper and its key sections. This process involved quickly scanning the title, abstract, figures, and section headings to grasp the paper’s main contributions, structure, and relevance to their interests. Skimming allowed participants to decide whether a section or a paper warranted deeper engagement.
- **Deep-diving**. When participants encountered specific information of interest, they engaged in a more focused and analytical reading process. This included highlighting key details, generating hypotheses, comparing insights with prior knowledge, seeking external references, and, in some cases, testing the information themselves. Deep-diving was often triggered by gaps in understanding, the need for validation, or a desire to apply the paper’s insights to their own work.

These two reading processes were not strictly separate; rather, participants often alternated between skimming and deep-diving based on their evolving information needs.
