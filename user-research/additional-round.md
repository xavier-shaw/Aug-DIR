[Survey Responses](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/191f_c47DenqMrQZhfk6OPkJEncA-xZBxxGJjoHtuZsk/edit#responses)

## Survey Motivation

While our interviews provided us with insight into the paper reading process itself, we would like to develop more detailed personas. This is critical since our proposed idea involves the tracking of changes to user intention throughout the reading process, yet we lack data regarding possible reading intentions that exist. The survey comprised questions about reader background, intention, and process.

## Reader Background

17 people responded to the survey, of which a majority were students, primarily undergraduates with some master’s students and a handful of PhDs. We also received responses from 2 industry professionals, but failed to obtain data from professional researchers. As such, we reason the results of our data will primarily reflect users of the student demographic.

In regards to field of study, around half of responders were based in engineering disciplines, while the remaining responders were split equally between math/statistics, social sciences, life sciences/medicine, and art/design.

The respondent pool was evenly distributed in terms of frequency of reading papers. The options we provided were daily, at least once a week, a few times a month, about once a month, a few times a year, or not at all. Based on this even distribution, we reason the later data on reading intention will be a reflection of a diverse set of reading habits, which is what we hoped to obtain through this survey.

## Reading Intention

Based on the survey results, readers most commonly read papers in order to conduct literature reviews for a project, find solutions to technical or research problems, or to stay updated on the latest developments in their field. Further, readers least commonly read papers in order to implement methods described in the paper, or gain a deeper understanding of a topic of personal interest. This data demonstrates that reader intention is primarily motivated by external factors such as a reader’s work, assignment, or project, rather than internal factors such as a reader’s affinity with the subject. What is more interesting about this data, is that the results were fairly evenly distributed, with only the course requirement reading intention receiving an outlier amount of votes. This underscores the diversity that exists among reading intentions as well as the need for a tool that may help bridge the gap between reading intentions.

Again, this notion is validated by the responses to the question about rereading research papers. A majority of respondents marked they reread research papers in order to accommodate their varying needs at the time of reading. Therefore, this implies that not only do different readers approach papers with highly varying intentions, but also that a single reader’s intention changes over time.

## Reading Process

A majority of responders employed a reading process of moderate depth. That is, they either read key sections (such as the intro, methodology, results, etc.) or read most of the paper closely but skipped complex details. The abstract, introduction, methodology, results, discussion/conclusion, and figures sections were most commonly focused on. Whereas a significantly less number of respondents focused on related work, references, or appendices sections.

These results confirm what we observed during our user interviews with one major exception: the survey respondents largely focused on figures whereas our user interviews tended to not. The focus on figures in the survey may be an indication that when given predefined options, respondents place more emphasis on quantitative aspects, whereas interviews (which are more exploratory) may reveal different priorities. At the moment, it is the perspective of our group that we will prioritize the user interview results over the user survey results in regards to figures, as the user interview results were derived from observed practices rather than participant reflections.
