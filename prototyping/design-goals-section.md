## Depth Assignment - Design Goals Section

### Model Paper and Why
The model paper we chose is _CiteSee: Augmenting Citations in Scientific Papers with Persistent and Personalized Historical Context_ by Chang et al.
We chose this paper because, although our system and theirs have different purposes, their system targets a user group and usage scenario similar to ours.

### Our Design Goals Section
Based on our formative study, we formulated the following design goals for a novel scientific paper reading interface to support users during paper reading:
- **[D1]** Scaffold the reading process into sessions with distinct goals, reducing redundant and overlapping information, and helping readers manage the cognitive overload in scientific papers while handling intention shifts more effectively.
- **[D2]** Capture and externalize highlights and notes to help readers track key information and progress within a single reading session. This will include temporal, relational, and positional perspectives, allowing users to better view, navigate, and understand their reading process.
- **[D3]** Connect relevant information across multiple reading sessions to support recall and insight development over time, aiding readers in organizing information from different sessions and building a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the paper.
- **[D4]** Provide a representation of reading progress and accumulated knowledge to support self-reflection and communication with others, facilitating further learning and collaboration.
